Key Considerations:
Efficient file processing: We will read the log file line by line to avoid loading the entire file into memory.
Performance: The script must be optimized for speed, handling large files efficiently.
Output: The logs for the specific date will be saved into a file (output_YYYY-MM-DD.txt).
